## Latency:

* Memory is fast but the disk is slow.
* Avoid disk seeks if possible.
* Simple compression algorithms are fast.
* Compress data before sending it over the internet if possible.
* Data centers are usually in different regions, and it takes time to send data between them.

## Availability numbers:

High availability is the ability of a system to be continuously operational for a desirably long period of time. High availability is measured as a percentage, with 100% means a service that has 0 downtime.

A **service level agreement (SLA)** is a commonly used term for service providers, that between you (the service provider) and your customer, and this agreement formally defines the level of uptime your service will deliver.
